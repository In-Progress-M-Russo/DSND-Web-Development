# Web Development Exercises

## Overview
Repo containing various exercises for the web development module included in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree

Contains examples on how to:
* Prepare a static dashboard front-end using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) ([here](exercises/Bootstrap_Exercise)),
* Create simple dynamic effects using Javascript and [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) ([here](exercises/Jquery_Exercise)),
* Use [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to create charts ([here](exercises/Plotly_Exercise))
* Set up a simple backend using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) ([here](exercises/Flask_Exercise))

## Requirements
In order to facilitate the execution of the backend exercises I have prepared an [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml) file to be used to install an environment with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads):

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After the installation the environment should be visible via `conda info --envs`:

```sh
# conda environments:
#
dsnd-webdev        /usr/local/anaconda3/envs/dsnd-webdev
...

```
